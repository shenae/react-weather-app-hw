# HOMEWORK: Weather App

![ui](https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/6387/files/ac9a086c-9fd8-11e8-9e0d-52091e56436b)

For this homework you'll be using the Open Weather API. You're going to be using react to display data from the API.

1. Fork and clone this repo and use create react app set up a new project.
2. Sign up for a free [Open Weather Map](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) account!
3. Once you've signed up, you're given an [API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys). Copy that API key and keep track of it somewhere!
4. Take a look at the API docs. All APIs are different so you need to study the documentation to see what the endpoints look like and what you will get back. 
5. Paste the URL into your browser to check out the data you're woking with and to verify that your key works. You can use a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en) to format the JSON response.  Alternatively, you can use an app like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to make a GET request.

```

## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

Your app has multiple components and does the following things:

- Handles the zip code input from the user
- Fetches data from the API when the zip code is submitted
- Parses the information that comes back from the API call
- Renders that information on the page
- API key is hidden in a `.env` file: 

`touch` a `.env` file in the root of your `create-react-app`. Create an environment variable to store your API key. In order to work the name of your env variable must start with `REACT_APP`. 
```
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=<api key here>
```

Include the `.env` file in the `.gitignore` file included with your `create-react-app` so that the `.env` file doesn't get pushed up to Github. Now you can use the enviroment variable you created in your code with `process.env`. For example:

```
  const gifs = await axios(`${GIPHY_URL}?api_key=${process.env.REACT_APP_GIPHY_API_KEY}&q=kittens`);
```

- **BONUS**: Include a button that converts the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius
- **BONUS**: Change the styling of the page based on weather conditions. 
- **BONUS**: Include the sunrise and sunset times (hint: maybe [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) will be helpful!) and some information about humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc.
- **BONUS**: Deploy your app on GH-pages (check the Create React App docs).


### To be thinking on

- Put a debugger into your HTTP request (axios call) to get a sense of what's happening. 
- What components should your app have?
- What components (if any) need state?
- How/when would you change state?
